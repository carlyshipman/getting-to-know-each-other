    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
</body>
<p>
    I am a freshman and currently a mathematics major. However, I am considering
    switching majors to exercise science and making my mathematics 
    a minor/double major in the future. The reason I want to switch is 
    becasuse I am very passionate about sports and the science behind what makes
    people injured and how the body functions. However, I still am very
    passionate about math and do not want to quit on something I love.
    I am on the Lewis University cross country and track teams. A lot of what
    I do on a day to day basis revolves around being a runner. Although 
    I've expierenced many 
    bumps in the road, I am still continuing doing what I love.

<p>
    I am a first generation college student, however my mother, Betsy, did attend 
    an art school after highschool. My father, Walter, began his work in 
    highschool, inheriting the buisness from my grandpa. Together, they now own and 
    operate two companies, S&S ChemDry and Pure Mold Free. I have a younger sister, Aubrey,
    who is currently 13 and an older brother, Noah. He is 18 and currently attends
    JJC.

<head><h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2></head>
<p>
    My favorite hobby is running. It helps me destress and mantain control
    over my life. When I feel like my life is a mess and out of my hands, it is 
    comforting knowing that I still have imput into what goes on within my life. 
    Additionally, I feel that it is part of a way to escape but also socially
    bond with others. Running is a very satisifing expirence, and every minute is worth the pain.

        generation, gave users a direct access to the computer
        with a keyboard and a screen.</a></p>
    <p> &#9632;<a href= "https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/turing-machine/one.html">Alan M. 
        Turing invented an mathematical model called a Turing machine, which paved the way 
        for computing</a></p>

<head><h2>Fun Fact</h2></head>
<p>
    I had a bubly addiction- which is a sparkling water brand. It actually may be one of the reasons I
     have a stress reaction in my femur. I have made a teir list of the flavors and collect the tops.
     I am working towards bettering myself and limiting myself to 3 a week.
